Event Management:

An event management company has two kinds of employees: managers and helpers. Helpers either smoke or they drink coffee. Managers are the organizers of events. The staff of an event consists of 10 helpers and 3 organizers and one of the latter is the chief organizer. It's the organizers' responsibility to make sure there are enough helpers and appropriate catering on the event. If everything is set, the event can start. The company organizes the following events:

cocktail parties - 5 hours long

weddings - 8 hours long

conferences - 10 hours long

On cocktail parties, helpers ask guests if they want more cocktail every 5 minutes. On weddings, helpers offer some wedding cake every 10 minutes. On conferences they inform the guests about where they can find snacks, but only once, at the start of the event. On top of that, every helper has a break in every 2 hours. They spend their break either smoking or drinking coffee, based on their preferences.
